4.5 years is a pretty good tenure at a tech startup. I'd like to rummage through my thoughts while they're still fresh on my mind. A lot of this will be just organic and a stream of consciousness of ideas that I can hopefully organize into a personal collection of standards and principles with which I can look back on and refer to.

### 1. Be kind.

This one's kind of a no-brainer, but I find that it bears mentioning. And I don't mean being superficially kind. I mean genuine kindness. The problem is we're all human beings and we all have to deal with our own...stuff. Some people are good at separating work from the personal, but realistically they bleed into each other. 

### 2. But don't be too kind :trollface:.

In another life, I was very much a "yes" man. It was almost like a race from the moment something was asked of me to the moment I responded. 

### 3. There are learners and there are 9-to-5'ers.

Some people just want to get in and get out. Work is just a means to an end. Fair enough. US salaries for software engineering jobs are, in my opinion, hyper-inflated compared to the rest of the world. The bar to entry is much lower in comparison to other financially lucrative jobs (read: doctor, lawyer) for the same or even higher pay. I'd argue that the work is also less strenuous.

Am I making sweeping generalizations that may or may not be true while simultaneously completely omitting the presentation of any source material to back up my claims?

*Abso-freaking-lutely!* 



### 4. Ideas are great, but they're just the tip of the iceberg.



### 5. Managers have a hard job.

I've yet to encounter a manager who was well-rounded, both technically and interpersonally. I want to recount my experience with the last couple of managers I've had.

**Manager A**: a member of the "old guard" from the finance world; ex-VP of a big bank; low EQ; 1:1s were pretty abysmal (to be fair, I was fresh out of college and I had no idea what kind of goals I wanted to think about let alone discuss), somewhat of a micro-manager; I knew there had to be better

**Manager B**: high to very high EQ; probably almost *too* high to a fault; it was satisfying, I felt like I was actually being listened to, but, in hindsight, it was a checklist; never got to see their technical ability, but knew that they were pretty knowledgeable in DevOps

**Manager C:** straight shooter, pretty technical, they built a lot of the infrastructure I worked on, medium EQ, arrogant

**Manager D:** highly technical; rolled sleeves up to get dirty, high EQ \*gasp\* but I don't think they really enjoyed being a manager; 1:1s were nice, but felt very surface level

All of this is pretty subjective and I recognize that any relationship, be it at work or in our personal lives, is a two-way street, so this is certainly not meant to be a knock on these wonderful people. Writing these experiences down is also not an admission of self-perfection because I am nowhere remotely to be being that. In fact, this is a bow in recognition of imperfection. I want to be hopeful of meeting a colleague who shows genuine care and can also show me a thing or two.

### 6. Documentation done well is a game changer.

### 7. Unattended toxicity is like rust, unaddressed, it can wreak havoc on a team.

### 8. Objectivity is a muscle that needs to be regularly exercised.

### 9. Pay very close attention to pain points.

### 10. Fail as early as you can as often as you can (within reason of course).

### 11. Legacy code is not dogma

### 12. "Absorb what is useful. Reject what is useless. Add what is essentially your own."
