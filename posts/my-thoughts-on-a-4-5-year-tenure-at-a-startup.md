4.5 years is a pretty good tenure at a tech startup. I'd like to rummage through my thoughts while they're still fresh on my mind. A lot of this will be just organic and a stream of consciousness of ideas that I can hopefully organize into a personal collection of standards and principles with which I can look back on and refer to.

### 1. Be kind.

This one's kind of a no-brainer, but I find that it bears mentioning. And I don't mean being superficially kind. I mean genuine kindness. The problem is we're all human beings and we all have to deal with our own...stuff. Some people are good at separating work from the personal, but realistically they bleed into each other. There are a lot of cynics, and passive-aggressive (read: "sassy") people who choose to focus on the negative. I won't mince my words.

It is a fucking drain.

I'm certainly not prescribing there to be a right or wrong way to interact with your peers. But, whatever happened to "engineering with empathy"? I've also realized that it's *frighteningly* easy to fall prey to unknowingly contributing to the negativity.

### 2. But don't be too kind :trollface:.

In another life, I was very much a "yes" man. It was almost like a race from the moment something was asked of me to the moment I responded. One takeaway from working at this startup was actually learning how to say no. I learned to have a healthy dose of skepticism when it came to breaking down how to build a product or feature. I also learned the importance of leaning on standards and best practices and using them as leverage when push comes to shove.

### 3. There are learners and there are 9-to-5'ers.

Some people just want to get in and get out. Work is just a means to an end. Fair enough. US salaries for software engineering jobs are, in my opinion, hyper-inflated compared to the rest of the world. The bar to entry is much lower in comparison to other financially lucrative jobs (read: doctor, lawyer) for the same or even higher pay. I'd argue that the work is also less strenuous.

Am I making sweeping generalizations that may or may not be true while simultaneously completely omitting the presentation of any source material to back up my claims?

*Abso-freaking-lutely!* 

I guess what I'm trying to get at is that it's hard to find other like-minded people who have a desire to be lifelong learners day in and day out. Work is not just a means to an end, it's also a place of constant learning.

### 4. Ideas are great, but they're just the tip of the iceberg.

I firsthand saw how an idea became reality. Working at an established company, I've found that it was surprisingly hard for an idea to materialize into actual pointed work in the backlog. A lot of the "pre-work", or if we're talking about this iceberg metaphor, what's underneath the water, involves a lot of pulling and tugging on the "right" people. Who the "right" people are, takes some sleuthing to figure out. But, sometimes even that's not enough. Sometimes you need a bit of luck as well. Sometimes you need to be obnoxious. I've noticed that the people who complained the most and more importantly, the most *frequently* seemed to garner the biggest audience. 

"X sucks, I hate working on this legacy system."

"Well, you seem distressed, what should we do?"

"Let's rearchitect the system using Y and Z."

A blatantly simplistic example, but, it captures the essence of it. There's a lot of pre-work needed to mobilize ideas. There are also varying approaches to getting an idea mobilized.

### 5. Managers have a hard job.

I've yet to encounter a manager who was well-rounded, both technically and interpersonally. I want to recount my experience with the last couple of managers I've had.

**Manager A**: a member of the "old guard" from the finance world; ex-VP of a big bank; low EQ; 1:1s were pretty abysmal (to be fair, I was fresh out of college and I had no idea what kind of goals I wanted to think about let alone discuss), somewhat of a micro-manager; I knew there had to be better

**Manager B**: high to very high EQ; probably almost *too* high to a fault; it was satisfying, I felt like I was actually being listened to, but, in hindsight, it was a checklist; never got to see their technical ability, but knew that they were pretty knowledgeable in DevOps

**Manager C:** straight shooter, pretty technical, they built a lot of the infrastructure I worked on, medium EQ, arrogant

**Manager D:** highly technical; rolled sleeves up to get dirty, high EQ \*gasp\* but I don't think they really enjoyed being a manager; 1:1s were nice, but felt very surface level

All of this is pretty subjective and I recognize that any relationship, be it at work or in our personal lives, is a two-way street, so this is certainly not meant to be a knock on these wonderful people. Writing these experiences down is also not an admission of self-perfection because I am nowhere remotely to be being that. In fact, this is a bow in recognition of imperfection. I want to be hopeful of meeting a colleague who shows genuine care and can also show me a thing or two.

### 6. Documentation done well is a game changer.

### 7. Unattended toxicity is like rust, unaddressed, it can wreak havoc on a team.

### 8. Objectivity is a muscle that needs to be regularly exercised.

### 9. Pay very close attention to pain points.

### 10. Fail as early as you can as often as you can (within reason of course).

### 11. Legacy code is not dogma

### 12. "Absorb what is useful. Reject what is useless. Add what is essentially your own."
