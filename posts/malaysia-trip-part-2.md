Every year we've come to Malaysia, we always make a point of visiting Malacca. There's an 80+ year old grandpa by the name of "Ah Hee" that owns a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_centre">hawker stall</a> in Malacca where he sells "yu kiao" (pronounced "Eee key-ow"). The literally translation is "fish paste noodles". He's been in business for at least 40 years now. He still remembers when my father-in-law was brought along with <em>his</em> mom when he was a kid. 

The noodle I got was a yellow egg noodle (similar to ramen), and in classic style, was drenched in pork fat. And just like the previous years, the experience was pure bliss as soon as I started slurping down the silky smooth noodles. It'll be a sad day when Grandpa Ah Hee is no longer with us. Each year we visit, there's a slight feeling of anticipation, asking each other if he'll still be there cooking up those delicious bowls of noodle heaven.

Thank you Grandpa Ah Hee for warming our bellies with your delicious food. I hope you've got a few more healthy years ahead of you. See you next year!
