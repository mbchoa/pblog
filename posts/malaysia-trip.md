<p style="font-size: 1.75rem; font-weight: 900">Malaysia Trip: Part 1</p>

My partner and I along with the little one have been staying in Malaysia for close to three months now. I managed
to mark off one of my goals for the year by finishing a book,
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6346975-moonwalking-with-einstein" target="_blank">
  <em>Moonwalking with Einstein</em>
</a>
&nbsp;by Joshua Foer. I couldn't put it down! The author writes about his adventures learning how to develop
better memory.

One memory strategy I read about that was cool and reasonably practical to implement is using an imaginary construct
called a "memory palace". The basic gist of the strategy is to use a well known location from our memory as a canvas
and to place onto the canvas whatever it is you are trying to commit to memory. For each thing you're remembering,
it's a good practice to get creative with how you paint the visual and focusing intently on trying to use multiple
senses to sear the "thing" into your memory palace. In order to remember multiple things, you walk through the location
and place the thing to remember in memorable locations.

In the book, the author is instructed to remember a list of grocery items to buy using a memory palace. I actually
performed this exercise as I read along and used the apartment that I used to live in with my parents as my memory
palace.

First, I placed a jar of pickles at the doorstep of the apartment. Next, I entered and imagined a small kid's 
pool filled with cottage cheese at the entrance of the apartment. The more absurd and more vivid the creation, the 
better it stuck in my memory. Following that, I walked to the right and into the living room and on the wall to the
right of me was a bookshelf with a collection of ornaments my mom collected over the years. I placed a plate of 
cured salmon on the third shelf from the top. To the left of the bookshelf was our TV sitting on top of a long
TV stand with cabinets below containing DVDs. In front of the TV, I placed three bottles of wine. To get creative
with the wine, I used the same idea from the book and anthropomorphized each of the wine bottles. The three bottles
were now all yelling at each other boasting that they were the superior wine.

As I was doing this exercise, I was slowly becoming reluctant to continue for fear that I would begin to forget
about the items in the beginning. After each item, I would go back to the beginning and trace my steps through
the apartment to reinforce my memory. To spice things up, I even started adding famous people at each checkpoint.
Now, posing in front of the apartment was Jennie with a jar of pickles resting on her left palm. Yes, Jennie from 
BLACKPINK. And in the kid's pool at the entrance of the apartment lay Ros√© swimming in the cottage cheese.

It's been more than a week now since I've finished the book and I can still vividly remember and retrace my steps
through the apartment and remember where I left all these items. Practically speaking, I haven't encountered another
scenario since I did this exercise where I could leverage this technique. Additionally, it took me some time to
imagine each item at each step. I'm sure with some more practice, I can probably drastically decrease the time it
takes me to commit things into memory.

Having read the book, it made me wonder how I could've benefited from having access to a tool like this during my
academic years needing to memorize and fill my head with all those important facts and formulas and significant
events, etc. I'll need to think of another place to use as my next memory palace and find a more challenging
collection of things to remember.
