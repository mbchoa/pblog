My wife and I were told that there was a high possibility that she may have cancer two weeks ago.

A week later, my wife went through an extensive surgery that took away her ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, colon, spleen, appendix and she was diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer.

Suffice to say, it's been a whirlwind of mental and emotional ups and downs the last week or so. Lots of introspection. Lots of thoughts about the future.

My wife is strong. One of the strongest and most resilient human beings I've ever known. It's what I love about her. That said, there were nights leading up to the surgery where I just felt a crushing sadness for her. She'd be lying next to me asleep, baby girl sprawled between us, while my mind wandered for the next couple of hours. Some nights I would wonder where it all started.

"Was it the food we ate?"

"Was it the stress?"

Some nights I would think about what she was feeling, what was going through her mind, her anxiety, the suddenness of it all.

While this has been a painful process, on the positive spectrum of things, it's given me a chance to, I suppose, "wake up" and understand that there are some really unproductive, non-value-creating behaviors and actions I've adopted over the course of the last couple of years that need addressing. 

There's an acknowledgement from both of us. This was a life-changing event. We've both lost and gained from this experience, mentally, physically, spiritually. I have gratitude for what we've gone through, what we're currently going through and what we'll face in the future.
